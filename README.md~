# paragliding

so, i didn't use openstack because i thought the time investment to learn how to use it wasn't worth it considering that so many other parts of the project where incomplete so near the deadline.

you'll also see that a lot of my code is completely retarded, because i didn't have the time to do things the way i probably should and just decided to go with the whole if it works it's good enough thingamagig.

i didn't use aws lambda for the same reason as openstack
